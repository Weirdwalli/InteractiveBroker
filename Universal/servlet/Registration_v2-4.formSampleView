**INTERACTIVE BROKERS DISCLOSURE REGARDING USE OF THE IMPACT DASHBOARD AND IMPACT APP**\n\nThe IMPACT Dashboard and the IMPACT Application (\"IMPACT\") offered by Interactive Brokers (\"IBKR\") allow users to view information about your portfolios and individual companies based on environmental, social, and corporate governance (\"ESG\") criteria selected by the user.\n\n***ESG Information Is Provided for Informational Purposes Only and Based on the Criteria Selected by You.***\n\nIBKR provides ESG scoring and data for informational purposes only. It is not intended as a recommendation that you buy or sell any securities or an offer or solicitation to buy or sell securities.  Rather, it is intended to compare the ESG performance of the companies in your portfolio to the ESG criteria you select according to a formula developed by IBKR that weighs these criteria.  IBKR calculates ESG scores using data created and provided by multiple third-party ESG data vendors. IBKR then uses a proprietary algorithm to aggregate and process the data from these providers, weight it and present a combined ESG score for securities in a way that takes into account the ESG preferences that the user selects.  For more information on ESG Scoring, please review our [FAQs and White Paper](https://www.clientam.com/lib/cstools/faq/web1/index.hmtl#/tag/impact_methodology?isEmbedded=1).\n\n***ESG Information Does Not Reflect Non-ESG Factors That May Be Relevant To You.***\n\n**By using IMPACT, you acknowledge and agree that any ESG information provided is based solely on the ESG criteria you select.  The ESG scoring does not consider your age, other investments, financial situation and needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, or risk tolerance.  You acknowledge and agree that you intend for IBKR to provide information based solely on your ESG criteria selection and that your ESG criteria selections and the information IBKR provides based on those criteria may be inconsistent with your other investment objectives or considerations.**\n\nIMPACT users acknowledge and agree that IBKR does not provide financial advice and that they should obtain their own independent advice if needed.\n\n**You understand that trading in any security could lead to financial losses in your portfolio, and acknowledge and agree that the ESG information provided by IMPACT is not intended to and does not take into account the potential financial effects of trading in any security.  ESG scoring is not intended to have any correlation into investment performance.  Any decision to invest based on ESG information, data or considerations could result in your portfolio underperforming a non-ESG focused portfolio or the market as a whole.  Replacing securities in your portfolio with those displayed in the Impact Tools may result in immediate or future financial losses.**\n\n***ESG Information Is Based on Third-Party Data and May Differ from ESG Information Provided by Other Firms.***\n\nThe underlying ESG data used in IMPACT is created by multiple third-party ESG data providers.  IBKR makes no representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied, as to the validity or content of the data being provided by these third parties. In particular, errors in the quality, timeliness, completeness or accuracy of the third-party information and data used in the IMPACT Tools may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the third-party data providers or IBKR for a period of time or at all, which may or may not affect the accuracy of the ESG score you are provided. As there is currently no standard ESG reporting or scoring, the same security may be assigned materially different ESG scores by different ESG rating firms.
