                                <p>To help Advisors who bill advisory fees using one of IBKR's Automatic Calculation options meet their compliance obligations, we can send your clients invoices detailing the advisory fees automatically calculated and deducted from their accounts (as they have requested) when those fees are actually charged. These notices describe the method used to calculate the fee, the amount of the fee and the period covered by the fee.</p> 
                                <p>Some states' "custody" rules require that advisors send, or have their broker send, these invoices to clients who sign up for automatic billing of advisory fees. (You may also need to send these invoices to your clients if you have "custody" under the SEC's or your state's custody rule for another reason.) Please review the state (or SEC) rules relevant to your firm to determine if you need IBKR to send your clients these invoices.</p>
                                <p>This invoice functionality is discussed at several locations on the IBKR's website, including the Advisor Invoice Notifications section on <a href="am-notes-2016.php.html#2016-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this webpage</a>, the Invoice Notifications section <a href="../pricing/advisor-fees.php.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://guides.interactivebrokers.com/am/Default.htm#am/manageclients/advisor_invoicing.htm?TocPath=Manage%2520Clients%252FFunds%252FTraders%257CFees%257CAdvisor%2520Invoicing%257C_____0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this page</a>.</p>
                                <p>Please note that your state securities regulator may expect you to provide notice of relying on this invoice process in their Form ADV filings. Given that state laws vary, investment advisors may want to confirm with their legal counsel or compliance consultant that the invoice provided by Interactive Brokers satisfies your specific state requirements. For instance, some states may still expect advisors <b>themselves</b> to provide copies of this itemized invoice to their clients to satisfy the requirements of this provision (instead of completely relying on IBKR to do so).</p>

                <p>Interactive Brokers has reached preferred provider agreements with a variety of companies that offer RIA compliance and other services to advisory firms. These third-party service providers may be able to help new and existing investment advisors with their compliance and other related needs.</p>
                <p>Many of these service providers have agreed to offer discounts to investment advisors trading on the Interactive Brokers platform. These discounts are generally listed below, next to the provider's name. Some providers, however, have chosen not to publish a discount on this page but may offer discounts if the advisor mentions having been referred by Interactive Brokers.</p>
                <p>You can find preferred providers in the categories listed below. For each provider, we have included the provider's name, contact information, a short description of its services prepared by the provider and any discounts the provider asked IBKR to include.</p>

                                <p>Founded in 1933, Stark & Stark is a full service law firm representing advisory firms throughout the United States and Canada. Each of our clients receive the same level of responsive, customized service dictated by their individual needs, resulting in their preparedness for the most important, and singular reason to develop a compliance program - successfully completing an SEC exam. Stark & Stark offers a full-day Compliance Review, the scope and results of which are not subject to disclosure to the SEC during an exam, and includes a document review, <strong>document preparation</strong> of the required Annual CCO Review and Risk Assessment, and an exam review that covers <strong>all</strong> questions from the most current SEC exam and addresses the appropriate responses for topics like custody, cyber-security, performance presentations, conflict disclosures and due diligence procedures. As a result of the compliance review, firms will be better prepared for an SEC exam, and will be in much better positions to protect themselves from adverse client claims and/or regulatory actions.</p>
                                <p>In addition to on-site compliance reviews, we offer clients ongoing legal and compliance services including arbitration, litigation, regulatory, enforcement and employment matters. Instead of using the typical one–size–fits–all consulting model where everyone gets the same set of documents, we save clients time and resources by providing the specific, tailored services needed to be successful in the current regulatory environment. Stark & Stark has been successful in developing innovative solutions to meet our client's needs. Our attorneys act not only as legal counsel, but also as strategists and advisors. Our philosophy of putting the law to work for our clients continues to be the cornerstone on which we build and maintain our relationships.</p>

                                <p>Tolerisk® is a 2-dimensional risk tolerance assessment tool for all types of Investment Advisors and Financial Planners.  Unlike traditional 1-dimensional risk tolerance exercises which focus primarily on the client's willingness to accept risk, Tolerisk separately measures each client's willingness and ability to take investment risk by incorporating cash-flows.  All factors are combined into a simple, measurable, and actionable risk directive.  Tolerisk also demonstrates the key drivers of each client's risk tolerance, how it will likely evolve through time, and even the client's probability of outliving his money.  Learn how <a href="http://www.tolerisk.com/" target="_blank">Tolerisk</a> can help you grow your practice and demonstrate the highest fiduciary standards.</p>

Instead, give clients information that's always ready, on demand, and doesn't require you or your staff to "run a report."  Blueleaf displays that data in an easy-to-use client portal that comes equipped with built in managed and held away account data aggregation, a document vault, and an open api that connects to your CRM, financial planning software, and analytics tools.</p>

                <p>On Tuesday, Dec. 22, 2020, the SEC announced it had finalized reforms to modernize rules that govern investment adviser advertisements and compensation to solicitors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The rule replaces the current advertising rule’s broadly drawn limitations with principles-based provisions designed to accommodate the continual evolution and interplay of technology and advice, and includes tailored requirements for certain types of advertisements.

                <h2>Best Execution</h2>
                <h3>It's All About Meeting Your Best Execution Obligations</h3>
                <p>Investment advisors have a "best execution" duty to their clients. Generally speaking, the advisor must execute client trades through a broker that, all things considered, gets their clients a favorable deal on each trade. The advisor should take into account the broker's execution quality, commissions and fees and the quality of the brokerage services provided, among other things.</p>
                <p>If a regulator (or client) asks, an advisor needs to show that it has "considered the full range and quality of a broker's services when placing brokerage, including, among other things, execution capability, commission rate, financial responsibility, responsiveness to the adviser, and the value of any research services provided." Exchange Act Release No. 23,170 (April 23, 1986).</p>
                <p>This is a continuing obligation—advisors shosuld periodically evaluate the performance of the brokers executing client trades.</p>

                <p>IBKR stands behind its execution quality.

                <p>Like all brokers, IBKR files a quarterly report pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Rule 606 describing its order routing practices. This report describes how and where customer orders are routed when customers use IBKR's Smart Order Routing System rather than directing their order to a particular market center. These reports are a standard part of the best execution information regulators expect advisors to review.</p>

                <h3>Information About Interactive Brokers' Record</h3>
                <p>Your clients, administrators, auditors and/or regulators may ask about Interactive Brokers' record as a custodian and broker and ask you what due diligence you have done. Or you may be wondering about IBKR's record and doing due diligence yourself.</p>
                <p>To help you answer these questions, Interactive Brokers' General Counsel has prepared a memo detailing Interactive Brokers' strong financial position, close regulatory oversight, experienced management, worldwide best execution and low cost that you can provide to regulators, clients, auditors, administrators or other third-parties. We have also included a series of links on this page demonstrating IBKR's fitness as a custodian and broker.</p>
                <p>As these materials demonstrate, the combination of Interactive Brokers' extremely strong capital position, experienced and cautious management, strict regulatory oversight, best execution technology and low cost increasingly make IBKR the first choice for prime brokerage, clearing, and custody services for financial advisors who want to provide a safe, secure and cost-effective global investment platform for their clients.</p>
